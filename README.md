# Numerical-Optimization
This repository includes labs and submission files for Numerical Optimization course at ITI-AI  

1. Linear Regression 
2. Gradient Descent types {batch, mini-batch, stochastic}
3. Gradient Descent optimization techniques {momentum, NAG}
4. Gradient Descent optimization techniques {Adagrad, Rmsprop, Adam}

- edits to be done:
   * adding comments
   * putting these functions into a class
   * merging all the files together
